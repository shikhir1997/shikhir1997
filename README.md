- **COOKIE POISONING, DNS, XSS TESTING FOR WEB APPLICATION FIREWALLS(http://sersc.org/journals/index.php/IJAST/article/view/11922)**  
  *Authors: Shikhir Goel, J.Prabakaran, Vibhav Beejawat, Meghana kandarpa.*  
  *Published in: International Journal of Advanced Science and Technology, 29(6s), 2533-2537, 2020*  
  *Abstract*:Network security is a major concern in modern cloud computing. Web application firewalls protect online systems, but vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting (XSS), DNS attacks, and cookie poisoning persist. We propose a fuzzy logic and machine learning-based method, leveraging software-defined networking (SDN) rules to detect and block malicious IPs automatically. The system routinely updates the block list, reducing false alarms and enhancing efficiency while mitigating hacker intrusion.
